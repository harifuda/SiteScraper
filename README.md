# SiteScraper
- This is my simple web scraper done using Playwright for Java, fetches the first 15 pages of the "Cards and Tarot" section and stores the first 37 items into a MySQL database.
- There are 12 items/page, so 15 x 12 = 180 items are scraped.
- The items are then sorted from least to most expensive
